## Background

I was developing an Augmented Reality app that would display Points of Interest in a camera view based on the user's geo location. I whipped up this handy demo as I wanted to compare the difference between the datasets returned by the Foursquare and the Yelp search APIs. As you can see, the points of interest returned by Foursquare appear a lot denser than those from Yelp. This is by no means a qualitative assessment of their search APIs but it would be interesting to see what each party has to say regarding this issue.
